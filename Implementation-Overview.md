# NYC DOB Job Filings Explorer - Implementation Overview

This document provides an overview of the implementation choices and architecture for the NYC DOB Job Filings Explorer application.

## Project Structure

- **NycJobFilings.Data**: Data access layer with Entity Framework Core
  - Models: Domain entities representing NYC DOB job filings
  - Services: Core data services for column metadata, filtering, and progressive loading
  - Scripts: Utilities for data import and database initialization

- **NycJobFilings.Web**: Blazor Server web application
  - Pages: Razor components for the user interface
  - Shared: Common UI components and layouts

## Key Features Implemented

### Option A — Dynamic Columns & Preferences
- Column metadata loaded from configuration
- User interface for showing/hiding, reordering, and pinning columns
- User preferences stored and retrieved per user
- Column tooltips with descriptions
- Column width customization

### Option B — Filter Chips + Chart
- Filter chip UI for adding/removing filters
- Support for multiple filter types (date ranges, borough, job type, etc.)
- Filters apply to both grid and chart visualizations
- Filter sets can be saved/loaded
- Filter conditions combined with proper LINQ expressions

### Option C — Background/Progressive Loading
- Initial fast load of ~1,000 rows
- Background loading of additional batches (5,000 rows each)
- Progress indicator with cancellation support
- UI remains responsive during data loading
- Query optimization to select only visible columns

## Technical Decisions

1. **Data Storage**: SQL Server with appropriate indexes for job filings data
2. **Entity Framework Core**: ORM for data access with fluent mappings
3. **Dependency Injection**: Services properly scoped and configured
4. **Asynchronous Operations**: All data loading and saving is async for responsiveness
5. **Channel-based Processing**: Using System.Threading.Channels for progressive data loading
6. **LINQ Expression Trees**: Dynamic filter building based on user selections
7. **Metadata-driven UI**: Configuration-based approach for column management

## Sample Data Generation

We've included a data importer utility with three options:
- Import from NYC Open Data API (SoQL queries)
- Import from CSV exports
- Generate test data for development

## Performance Considerations

- Indexes on commonly filtered fields (latest_action_date, borough, job_type, job_status, initial_cost)
- Batch processing for large data loads
- Column selection optimization to reduce data transfer
- Async/await patterns throughout to maintain UI responsiveness
- Progressive loading to handle the ~2.7M row dataset efficiently

## Next Steps

1. Complete DevExpress DxGrid integration (would require license)
2. Add more sophisticated visualizations with DevExpress charting
3. Implement full-text search capabilities
4. Add Azure deployment with monitoring
5. Extend filtering with more complex conditions and combinations

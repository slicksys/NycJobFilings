# NYC DOB Job Filings Explorer - Project Summary

## Implementation Overview

The NYC DOB Job Filings Explorer is a Blazor Server application that demonstrates three key capabilities:

1. **Dynamic Columns & Preferences**: Metadata-driven column management with user preferences
2. **Filter Chips + Chart**: Smart filtering with visual filter chips and chart integration
3. **Background/Progressive Loading**: Responsive data loading with progress tracking

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: Blazor Server with component-based UI
- **Backend**: .NET 7 with Entity Framework Core
- **Database**: SQL Server with optimized schema for the NYC DOB Job Filings dataset
- **UI Components**: Bootstrap-based UI with placeholders for DevExpress components

## Project Structure

- **NycJobFilings.Data**: Data access and services
  - Models: Domain entities
  - Services: Core functionality for data operations
  - Scripts: Utilities for data import and setup

- **NycJobFilings.Web**: Blazor Server web application
  - Pages: Primary application screens
  - Shared: Reusable components
  - wwwroot: Static assets and CSS

## Key Components

### Dynamic Columns
The application implements a metadata-driven approach to column management through:
- `ColumnMetadataService`: Handles column configuration and user preferences
- Column preferences UI for customization
- Persistence of user settings

### Smart Filtering
The filter system includes:
- Visual filter chips for intuitive filtering
- Dynamic expression building with `FilterService`
- Filter persistence and reuse functionality
- Integration with grid and charts

### Progressive Loading
For handling large datasets, the application features:
- Fast initial load of first ~1,000 records
- Background loading with System.Threading.Channels
- Progress tracking with cancellation support
- Query optimization based on visible columns

## Development Decisions

- **SQL Server**: Chosen for robustness and indexing capabilities
- **Entity Framework Core**: ORM for data access with efficient querying
- **Metadata-Driven Approach**: Configuration over code for flexibility
- **Async/Await Pattern**: Used throughout for responsiveness
- **Component-Based UI**: Modular design for maintainability

## Running the Application

1. Set up the database using Entity Framework migrations
2. Import data using one of the provided methods
3. Launch the application with `dotnet run --project NycJobFilings.Web`

## Future Enhancements

- Complete DevExpress integration for advanced grid and chart capabilities
- Add full-text search functionality
- Implement more sophisticated visualization options
- Add user authentication and multi-tenant support
- Deploy to Azure with monitoring and telemetry
